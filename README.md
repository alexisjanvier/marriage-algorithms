Experiments with stable marriage algorithms

## Description

This package implements two kinds of algorithms:
- the Gale-Shapley algorithm that solves stable marriage problems
- the Roth-Shapley algorithm, also known as deferred acceptance algorithm, 
which solves the Resident-Hospital problem (i.e. marriage problems with 
capacities)
